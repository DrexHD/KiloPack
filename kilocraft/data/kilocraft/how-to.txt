Scoreboard naming: ke{module.name}_{name} eg: kevote_voted
Module:
A module must have a init and a loop function which are registered in the parent module. 
Loop functions are run once on load and have to loop themselves if necessary. 
Init functions need to initialize scoreboard objectives they need, they are usually only ever run by the user.
